### What I learned

I have learned how to fetch data from an API with asyn functions and use special methods from the API's

```js
const getIP = async function (ip) {
  try {
    const res = await fetch(`https://ipapi.co/${ip}/json/`);

    if (res.error) {
      renderError();
      throw new Error(`${res.status}`);
    }
    const data = await res.json();
    renderData(data);
  } catch (error) {}
};
```
