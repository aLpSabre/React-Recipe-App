### What I learned

I used the Edamam API as a developer for free and because of it I can`t use the API fully and can only one filter with diet and heal preferences. Firstly, I changed the input types to radio, so with the same name user could choose only one option but the problem is that radio buttons can not be unchecked. I learned that it is not possible to set the states multiple time in a map function.So I haD to make my own radio button with check buttons and set the state one time lastly. Here is my code:

```js
const handleRadio = (e) => {
  let array = input[e.target.name];

  const health = [
    "alcohol-free",
    "vegan",
    "vegetarian",
    "kidney-friendly",
    "pork-free",
  ];
  const diet = [
    "balanced",
    "high-protein",
    "low-carb",
    "low-fat",
    "low-sodium",
  ];
  if (e.target.checked) {
    array = [];
    array.push(e.target.value);

    const object = {};

    if (health.indexOf(e.target.value) !== -1) {
      health
        .filter((element) => element !== e.target.value)
        .map((element) => (object[element] = false));
      setCheck({ ...check, ...object, [e.target.value]: e.target.checked });
    } else {
      diet
        .filter((element) => element !== e.target.value)
        .map((element) => (object[element] = false));
      setCheck({ ...check, ...object, [e.target.value]: e.target.checked });
    }
  } else {
    array = [];
    setCheck({ ...check, [e.target.value]: false });
  }
  return setInput({ ...input, [e.target.name]: array });
};
```

I also learned how to useNavigate hook with useParams and use recipe id in a link to make an API call with it, so I can show to recipe details to the user and user can go to that recipe detail every time with the same link (It is not possible if you send the data with state in useNavigate hook.). Additionally, I learned that you have to encode the "#" in a link like this "owl%23$". 

```js
  const { id } = useParams();
  const get = async () => {
  const response = await axios(
    `https://api.edamam.com/search?app_id=${process.env.REACT_APP_EDAMAM_APP_ID}&app_key=${process.env.REACT_APP_EDAMAM_APP_KEY}&r=http://www.edamam.com/ontologies/edamam.owl%23${id}`
  );
```
I also learned how to use Context API, Firebase Authentication, Firestore, React Spinners ,React Lazy Load.
